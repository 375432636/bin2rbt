# bin2rbt Conversion Tool

## Introduction

This tool is a script for converting binary files to RBT format text files.

## Background

When using LPC11U35FHI33 as the download tool to upload data to ICE40UP5k, only RBT format files are supported. However, files generated by open source FPGA tools such as apio are in bin format and cannot be uploaded directly. After analyzing the RBT file format with moo, the development of this tool was completed.

## Operating environment

- Python3
- click
- datetime

## Usage

Run the script through the command line and use the following parameters:

```
python bin2rbt.py --binfile <BIN file> --rbtfile <RBT file>
```

Parameter explanation:

- --binfile: the filename of the original binary file, default is binfile.bin
- --rbtfile: the filename of the converted RBT file, default is rbtfile.txt
